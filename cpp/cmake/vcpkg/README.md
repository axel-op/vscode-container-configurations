# C++ with Vcpkg definition

This definition is based on the C++ default definition and set up the Vcpkg dependency manager.

By using this definition, you can directly use Vcpkg commands in the terminal of the container.

You can also set these commands in the `launch.json` or `tasks.json` of your project, so they're executed when you press F5. [Here's an example](https://github.com/axel-op/vscode-containerdevelopment-cpp-vcpkg).
