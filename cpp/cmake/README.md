# C++ with CMake

This folder contains definitions for C++ development with CMake. The container definitions set up the [CMake Tools extension](ms-vscode.cmake-tools
) in your instance of VS Code.

There is a configuration for each of these dependency managers:

- [Conan](https://conan.io/)
- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
