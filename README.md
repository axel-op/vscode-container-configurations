# VS Code Development Containers definitions extended

This repository contains some definitions and configuration files to be used with the [Remote extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) of Visual Studio Code.

These definitions are based on those from the [original repository of Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers), but contain some more useful tools.

## How to use it

The container definitions are in the `.devcontainer` folder. Usually, you just have to copy this folder to the root of your project. When there is also a `.vscode` folder, you should copy the values contained in its files.
